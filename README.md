# Face-Detection

Face detection is a computer vision problem in computer science that involves
identifying and locating human faces within digital images or video frames.
The primary objective of face detection is to determine whether a given image
or frame contains one or more human faces and, if so, to precisely locate
the position and possibly additional information about these faces within
the visual data. Face detection has a wide range of applications, including
facial recognition, emotion analysis, people counting, video surveillance, and
even in consumer applications like automatic tagging in photo management
software. Itâ€™s a fundamental building block in many computer vision systems
that deal with human interaction and analysis of visual data.

Implemented a face detection model using VGG16 neural network, combined with classificator and regressor.
